# KMP Sample Project

## Overview

This repository contains a complete sample project demonstrating Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) integration with Swift and Objective-C. It showcases practical solutions for handling type safety and interoperability issues between Kotlin and Swift, using generic components and custom wrappers.

## Features

- **Type Safety**: Ensures type-safe interactions between Kotlin and Swift/Objective-C.
- **Cross-Platform Flows**: Demonstrates how to handle Kotlin Flows and Swift Combine Publishers.
- **Custom Wrappers**: Provides examples of custom wrappers for seamless integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Kotlin**: Make sure you have Kotlin and Kotlin Multiplatform set up.
- **Xcode**: For iOS development with Swift.
- **Android Studio**: For Android development.

## Setup

- Clone the Repository
- Configure Dependencies
- For **iOS**: Open the Xcode project located in iosApp/ and build it.
- For **Android**: Open the Android Studio project and build it.

## Usage

- **Kotlin Flows to Swift Combine**: See how to convert Kotlin Flows to Swift Combine Publishers and vice versa.
- **Type-Safe Implementation**: Learn about the custom wrappers that maintain type safety across platforms.
